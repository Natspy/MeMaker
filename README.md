Signal_Dataset_Prepare is a file that outputs our signals test dataset (ECG_data.pkl) collected from an open source library at:

https://physionet.org/content/ecg-spider-clip/1.0.0/

To repackage the data, make sure to edit the 'folder' variable in the file.

Prototype_Data_Pipeline is a file that presents our proposed way of handling data and recommending pictures based on signal tags.
We focused on one experience ('Fear') as it is the easiest to detect in our chosen signals. It also matched with the dataset we have acquired.

You can also check out our project pitch and presentation!
